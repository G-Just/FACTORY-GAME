#Figure out how to make a projection system for readability
    [NOT IMPORTANT] Changes colors from transparent gray -> green when place is valid
    [NOT IMPORTANT] Add an animation that rotates around the top part of the projection 
        and swings based on the mouse movement
    Esc key should remove the event listener, right now it only removes the label + projection

    meaning it connects right to down replaces with correct belt shape

#Figure out how to generate materials from a miner and how are they going to be drawn on top of belts
