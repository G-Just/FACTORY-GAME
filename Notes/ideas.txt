#Projection system
Changes colors from transparent gray -> green when place is valid
Add an animation that rotates around the top part of the projection and swings based on the mouse movement

#Features
Esc key should remove the event listener, right now it only removes the label + projection
(Might need to reformat the code to enable removing the event listener (it is currently an anonymous function))

#Gameplay
Make the word bigger and make the camera able to pan around it
Zooming in + out?

#Economy
Introduce more buildings (smelter outputs something??)

#Sounds
Add game event sounds like gained money etc.
