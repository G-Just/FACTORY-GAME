# factory-game-website

* A website for a small grid based game. Game loop :
1. Building mines on an ore deposits
2. Transporting mined ore via conveyor belts to smelter building
3. Getting money for each ore transported.
4. Buying upgrades

* Interesting features (learning moments) :
1. Conveyor belt pathing (to connect them is multiple ways based on the placement direction)
2. Class based buldings, resources.
3. Using coockies and local storage to save current players data ( so the game does not reset after each reload )
