# factory-game-website

* A website for a small grid-based game. Game loop :
1. Building mines on an ore deposits
2. Transporting mined ore via conveyor belts to smelter building
3. Getting money for each ore transported.
4. Buying upgrades

* Interesting features (learning moments) :
1. Conveyor belt pathing (to connect them in multiple ways based on the placement direction)
2. Class-based buildings, resources.
3. Using cookies and local storage to save the current player's data ( so the game does not reset after each reload )
4. Making the game world bigger than the screen (enabling panning by dragging the mouse)
